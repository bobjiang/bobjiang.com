# Glossary

A

[Acceptance Test Driven Development (ATDD)](https://www.agilealliance.org/glossary/atdd/)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Acceptance Test Driven Development (ATDD) involves team members with different perspectives (customer, development, testing) collaborating to write acceptance tests in advance of implementing the corresponding functionality. [(see more)](https://www.agilealliance.org/glossary/atdd/)

[Acceptance Testing](https://www.agilealliance.org/glossary/acceptance/)
------------------------------------------------------------------------

An acceptance test is a formal description of the behavior of a software product, generally expressed as an example or a usage scenario. A number of different notations and approaches have been proposed for such examples or scenarios. In many cases the aim is that it should be possible to automate the execution of such tests by a software tool, either ad-hoc to the development team or off the shelf. [(see more)](https://www.agilealliance.org/glossary/acceptance/)

[Antipattern](https://www.agilealliance.org/glossary/antipattern/)
------------------------------------------------------------------

Antipatterns are common solutions to common problems where the solution is ineffective and may result in undesired consequences. [(see more)](https://www.agilealliance.org/glossary/antipattern/)

[Automated Build](https://www.agilealliance.org/glossary/automated-build/)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

In the context of software development, build refers to the process that converts files and other assets under the developers' responsibility into a software product in its final or consumable form. The build is automated when these steps are repeatable, require no direct human intervention, and can be performed at any time with no information other than what is stored in the source code control repository. [(see more)](https://www.agilealliance.org/glossary/automated-build/)

[Backlog Grooming / Backlog Refinement](https://www.agilealliance.org/glossary/backlog-grooming/)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Backlog grooming is when the product owner and some, or all, of the rest of the team refine the backlog on a regular basis to ensure the backlog contains the appropriate items, that they are prioritized, and that the items at the top of the backlog are ready for delivery. [(see more)](https://www.agilealliance.org/glossary/backlog-grooming/)

[Behavior Driven Development (BDD)](https://www.agilealliance.org/glossary/bdd/)

[Continuous Deployment](https://www.agilealliance.org/glossary/continuous-deployment/)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Continuous deployment aims to reduce the time elapsed between writing a line of code and making that code available to users in production. To achieve continuous deployment, the team relies on infrastructure that automates and instruments the various steps leading up to deployment, so that after each integration successfully meeting these release criteria, the live application is updated with new code. [(see more)](https://www.agilealliance.org/glossary/continuous-deployment/)

[Continuous Integration](https://www.agilealliance.org/glossary/continuous-integration/)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Continuous Integration is the practice of merging code changes into a shared repository several times a day in order to release a product version at any moment. This requires an integration procedure which is reproducible and automated. [(see more)](https://www.agilealliance.org/glossary/continuous-integration/)

[CRC Cards](https://www.agilealliance.org/glossary/crc-cards/)
--------------------------------------------------------------

Class Responsibility Collaborator (CRC) Cards are an object oriented design technique teams can use to discuss what a class should know and do and what other classes it interacts with. [(see more)](https://www.agilealliance.org/glossary/crc-cards/)
