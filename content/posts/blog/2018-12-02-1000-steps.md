1000 steps to the goal,

which means continuous improvement,

if 1000 steps to different goal, it is not continuous improvement,

it is just 1000 steps, and cannot combine together.

compound interest from 1000 steps should go toward ONE goal,

My goal is to build a community or tribe around blockchain technology,

thus to find a way to monetize open source developer.
