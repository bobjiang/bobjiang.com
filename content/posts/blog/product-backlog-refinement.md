Here I would like to talk about product backlog refinement meeting, including what activities should be in this meeting, who should join this meeting and why we need refinement meeting.

#### Why to have product backlog refinement meeting

As the figure above, it occurs during sprint for product backlog refinement meeting, and normally no more than 5% total time of sprint. E.g during sprint 1, Product Owner (PO) will conduct refinement meeting for sprint 2 and sprint 3. So refinement is like beam of a car, normally we should choose low-beam model, otherwise we would like to watch something far away ahead, we need to switch the headlights to high-beam model. Refinement is the high-beam model for team. (Thank Daniel Teng for above metaphor)

#### What to be included in refinement

There are 4 types of activities during refinement as illustrated in above figure.

1. Add a Product Backlog Item (PBI) - a new PBI could emerge during sprint, then team should add it into Product Backlog (PB). By the way, for this new PBI, it should follow [INVEST rule](http://xp123.com/articles/invest-in-good-stories-and-smart-tasks/).
2. Delete a PBI - if market changes, perhaps one PBI is required to remove because it cannot meet users' needs.
3. Modify or update a PBI, another 4 kinds of behaviours:
    - Split a large user story or epic into some small user stories. Please refer to [split user story methods](http://www.agileforall.com/2012/01/new-story-splitting-resource/) by Richard Lawrence.
    - Re-order the PBIs according to new market chance.
    - Re-estimate new PBI or new splitted small PBIs
    - Update acceptance criteria
4. Adapt release plan

#### Who should join refinement meeting

This meeting is responsible by PO, sometime PO would invite stakeholders/customers to join to clarify requirements, sometime PO would invite dev team to join to discuss technical details, and sometime PO would work on it by himself/herself.

Anything else should be related with product backlog refinement? Please leave your comments.
