This is marketing, a new book from Seth Goddin,

a genius of marketing,

I am one of his fans, 

learning how to do marketing in the new world,

digital age,

his latest book is a great encapsulation of many of his major themes:

- The job of marketers is to change people through stories
- Go for the smallest viable market (as opposed to the minimum viable product)
- "When you know what you stand for, you don't need to compete."
- "People like us do things like this."
- Treat different people differently
- Price is a story you are telling
- "Trust is as scarce as attention."
- Earn the permission to send regular, expected communications to your customers
- "Who would miss you if you didn't show up?"
- Organize and lead your tribe
- "If people care, you've got a brand."
