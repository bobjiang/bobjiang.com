do right things,

do things right,

very similar, but total different consequence,

if focusing do things right, 

then easy to dive into the details

if focusing do right things,

then needs the deep thinking, 

like:

- meditation
- reading
- writing
- etc.

so I would like to do right things first, and then do things fast (not right)

I don't know which way is right, and then I have to do things fast, and in small,

even failed, it is only a small cost, 

it doesn't matter.

Aka, fast fail, or lean startup, or agile.
