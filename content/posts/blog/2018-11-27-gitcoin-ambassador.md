## What is Gitcoin
[Gitcoin](https://gitcoin.co/) is a community for developers to collaborate and monetize their skills while working on Open Source projects through bounties.

So if you're a developer, please come to visit [Gitcoin](https://gitcoin.co/), and goto issue explorer and look for your professional skills to make the world better.

## What is Gitcoin Ambassador
[Gitcoin Ambassador program](https://medium.com/gitcoin/the-gitcoin-ambassador-program-35c2210c8c79) is an initiative to grow community and invest in our (Gitcoin) contributors. 

Gitcoin is aiming to become the most community friendly open source project on the web. As an ambassador, you’ll help us realize this goal; you’ll help us define what it means to be a Web 3.0 project.

## Why I choose this Ambassador
I start to notice Gitcoin from March 2018, and am inspired not only by the mission, to build a community for developers to collaborate and monetize their skills during open source projects, but also by the spirit #givefirst from the main founder -- Kevin Owocki. 

I am a Certified Scrum Trainer, aka Scrum envangerlist in the world from [ScrumAlliance](https://scrumalliance.org), and I love to help others (including people and organization) to find a better way for work and life. 

So I decided to join Gitcoin Ambassador program to help developers from open source project, to make a better world.
