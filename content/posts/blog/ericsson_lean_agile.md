Linda给我的触动非常大，71岁的老太太还可以从千里之外飞过来演讲。

并且她的演讲中small success, reflection regularly都再次打动我。

从与她的聊天中得知，2011年日本刚刚地震后的一个月，Linda就去日本做了Keynote演讲，令人敬佩！

随后她去某日本大学请教关于日本人长寿的秘诀，分享了两条给我们：

1. No word for retirement – 活到老，干到老。退休后为兴趣而工作。
2. 80% for every meal – 每顿饭只吃八成饱。

以下我一些流水账，以及我听的演讲中的要点：

Retrospective is not – no naming, no blaming. But naming and praising are encouraged.
