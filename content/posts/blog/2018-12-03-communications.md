It's "沟通" in Chinese for communication. And there are 2 characters in the word "沟通", which is "沟" and "通".

The goal of communication is shared understanding, also "通", not just connection (it's "沟").

The meaning of "沟" is to build connections, it's not the final goal, but the ways for communications.

Interesting and great Chinese!
