# Think BIG, act small

First heard this sentence 'think big, but act small', I am totally inspired. Why?

I am a trainer, and have many friends like me as trainers or consultants. Often I have some 'great' ideas, but I didn't move forward, so I would miss some opportunities as well. Then if I have any idea, and would like to make it real, and I have to do something, aka. act a small step. 

Based on last topic, '[delivery vs. discovery](https://bobjiang.com/delivery-vs-discovery)', in order to measure 'delivery', we need to set a big goal (which means think big), but we also need to set small target for each small step. 

## My story about think big and act small
I would like to share my story about acting small with think big.

Here is my CST journey.

Maybe you know, Certified Scrum Trainer (CST) is certified by [ScrumAlliance](http://scrumalliance.org), which is hard to get it. I am so honored to be one of CSTs, to promote Scrum all over the world. See more details, visit [ScrumAlliance](http://scrumalliance.org).

In 2014, I got to know CST and the business model, and then I had a goal to be a CST. In the following 3 years, all my small actions towards this big goal. E.g I tought multiple-day Scrum class, and I involved more agile community activities. Also I gave speeches in many conferences.

There is a minimal requirement for applying CST, like a measurement for me, or my north star. Finally I got CST in the late of 2016.
